		<p>When a nutrient is inactivated in Formulation Cloud, it becomes obsolete for use within the client. The inactivated nutrient will be highlighted in yellow in the Master Nutrients window, and the check box in the Obsolete column will be selected.</p>
		<p class="keep">For example, the following image shows that the &lt;SWDIGPHOS nutrient is obsolete since it has a yellow background:</p>
		<p>
			<img src="../../Resources/Images/R21/ObsoleteNutrients.png">
			</img>
		</p>
		<p>Obsolete nutrients should be deleted from all diets and products in the client, as the nutrient is no longer valid for use.</p>
		<h5>How to Delete Obsolete Nutrients:</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>In the <b>Master Nutrients</b> window, identify obsolete nutrients by finding the ones that are highlighted in yellow and have the <b>Obsolete</b> check box selected.</p>
				<div class="Tip">
					<p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Click the <b>Obsolete</b> column heading to sort the nutrient list and group all obsolete nutrients together.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Select the obsolete nutrients that you want to delete.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Click the <b>Delete</b> button <img src="../../../../MAXUserGuide/Content/Resources/Images/DeleteButton.png"></img>. The confirmation window appears.</p>
				<p>If the nutrients are being used in any product or diet, and the nutrients have a minimum or maximum constraint, the associated products and diets will be listed. This allows you to adjust the nutrients in the associated products or diets if needed before deleting the nutrients.</p>
				<p>If the nutrients are being used in any product or diet, but the nutrient does not have a minimum or maximum constraint, the associated products and diets will not be listed.</p>
				<p class="keep">For example, the following image shows that the obsolete nutrient, Niacin (B3), is used in multiple products and diets:</p>
				<p>
					<img src="../../Resources/Images/R21/ObsoleteNutrients2.png" class="thumb">
					</img>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Click the <b>Delete</b> button to continue the deleting process.</p>
				<p class="CellBody">Click <b>Cancel</b> if you want to make adjustments to the nutrient constraints in the associated products or diets before you delete the nutrients.</p>
				<p class="CellBody">The deleted nutrients will be removed from all diets and products in which they were used.</p>
				<div class="BodyNOTE">
					<p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The status of diets and products that contain obsolete nutrients that have either a minimum or maximum constraint changes to unformulated when the obsolete nutrient is deleted. The status of diets or products that contained the deleted nutrient that had no constraints does not change.</p>

		<p>9. Validate that if user checks 'New' then the 'New' column represents nutrient composition from the source blend.</p>
		<p>10. Validate that if user matches the source blend ingredient to the target then the 'New' column represents the nutrient composition from target site ingredient.</p>
