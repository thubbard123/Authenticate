                                        <p>A new field named Shrink % has been added to the Advanced Pricing area of the Product Price tab. The field displays the percentage of the product that will be lost during manufacturing associated with feed form.</p>

                                        <p>The two fields work together to _________________?</p>
                                        <p>Details about the new columns follow:</p>
                                        <p><b>Min Weight %</b>
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Displays the minimum weight percentage [DESCRIPTION]</p>
                                        <p>An alert appears when you enter a minimum ingredient inclusion in the formula and when the ingredients you have entered are below the minimum inclusion. The alert prompts you to address the issue before you order the product. Previously, this step occurred at formulation in BILLS and required additional communication time as formulators contacted consultants about changes in the formula before it went to production.</p>
                                        <p>Min Weight % is calculated for each ingredient as follows:&#160;Minimum Weight / Minimum Batch Weight * 100. If the value in the Minimum Weight field for the plant ingredient is equal to 0 or null, or the value in the Minimum Batch Weight field for the location is equal to 0 or null, no value is displayed in the Min Weight % field.</p>
                                        <p>For example, if the Minimum Weight was .033 and the Minimum Batch Weight was 2000, the calculated percentage is: .033/2000 * 100 = .00165%.</p>
                                        <p>If the Minimum Weight % value is greater than the value in the product result field, the background color of the Minimum Weight % field will turn <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">yellow</span>. The yellow background indicates that the ingredient does not meet the minimum weight quantity required in BILLS – it will potentially be rounded out in BILLS and not included in the final product. You should adjust the product before submitting it to the formulator. If you do not adjust the product before submitting/ordering it, the formulator will need to adjust the product formula to meet product nutrient requirements. Turn the results in both columns yellow if this case is true.</p>
                                        <p><b>Rounding Factor % </b>

                                        <p>Displays [DESCRIPTION]</p>
                                        <p>Rounding Weight % is calculated for each ingredient as follows:&#160;Rounding Weight / Minimum Batch Weight * 100. If the value in the Rounding Weight field for the plant ingredient is equal to 0 or null, or the value in the Minimum Batch Weight field for the location is equal to 0 or null, no value is displayed in the Rounding Factor % field.</p>
                                        <p>For example, if the Rounding Weight was .005, and the Minimum Batch Weight was 2,000, the calculated percentage is: .005/2000 * 100 = .00025%. If the value in the Rounding Weight field for the plant ingredient is equal to zero or null, or the value in the Minimum Batch Weight field for the location is equal to 0 or null, then the value displayed in this field should be null.</p>
                                        <p>If the value in the ingredient result for the product formula is less than the Minimum Weight %, value and greater than or equal to the Minimum Weight % minus the Rounding Factor %, then the background color of the Rounding Factor % field will turn turned <span style="background-color: #00ffff;">blue</span>. The blue background indicates that the ingredient will be rounded up to the Min Weight Quantity % in BILLS, and the ingredient will still be included in the final product. You can set a minimum on that ingredient at the Minimum Weight % to do this in MAX. Turn the results in both columns blue if this case is true. If this case is not true, and the first case is still true, leave the results yellow in both columns.</p>
                                        <p>The values displayed in the Minimum Weight % or the Rounding Factor % fields should not change by the selection of the imperial / metric setting selected within the view menu on the Product Worksheet screen as the values in these two fields stored on the client have already taken into account the minimum production batch size (the metric or imperial setting) of the plant location.</p>
