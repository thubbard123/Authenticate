		<p>When a nutrient is inactivated in Formulation Cloud, it becomes obsolete for use within the client. The inactivated nutrient will be highlighted in yellow in the Master Nutrients window, and the check box in the Obsolete column will be selected.</p>
		<p class="keep">For example, the following image shows that the &lt;SWDIGPHOS nutrient is obsolete since it has a yellow background:</p>
		<p>
			<img src="../../Resources/Images/R21/ObsoleteNutrients.png">
			</img>
		</p>
		<p>Obsolete nutrients should be deleted from all diets and products in the client, as the nutrient is no longer valid for use.</p>
		<h5>How to Delete Obsolete Nutrients:</h5>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>In the <b>Master Nutrients</b> window, identify obsolete nutrients by finding the ones that are highlighted in yellow and have the <b>Obsolete</b> check box selected.</p>
				<div class="Tip">
					<p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">Click the <b>Obsolete</b> column heading to sort the nutrient list and group all obsolete nutrients together.</p>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>Select the obsolete nutrients that you want to delete.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Click the <b>Delete</b> button <img src="../../../../MAXUserGuide/Content/Resources/Images/DeleteButton.png"></img>. The confirmation window appears.</p>
				<p>If the nutrients are being used in any product or diet, and the nutrients have a minimum or maximum constraint, the associated products and diets will be listed. This allows you to adjust the nutrients in the associated products or diets if needed before deleting the nutrients.</p>
				<p>If the nutrients are being used in any product or diet, but the nutrient does not have a minimum or maximum constraint, the associated products and diets will not be listed.</p>
				<p class="keep">For example, the following image shows that the obsolete nutrient, Niacin (B3), is used in multiple products and diets:</p>
				<p>
					<img src="../../Resources/Images/R21/ObsoleteNutrients2.png" class="thumb">
					</img>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Click the <b>Delete</b> button to continue the deleting process.</p>
				<p class="CellBody">Click <b>Cancel</b> if you want to make adjustments to the nutrient constraints in the associated products or diets before you delete the nutrients.</p>
				<p class="CellBody">The deleted nutrients will be removed from all diets and products in which they were used.</p>
				<div class="BodyNOTE">
					<p MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;NOTE: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;">The status of diets and products that contain obsolete nutrients that have either a minimum or maximum constraint changes to unformulated when the obsolete nutrient is deleted. The status of diets or products that contained the deleted nutrient that had no constraints does not change.</p>

		<p>A new button named Update Price has been added to the Product Price tab. This button is only available Change Product mode.</p>
		<p>Click the button to go out and replace the value in the Net Delivered Price field with a value that would maintain the same value in the Value Addition field for the previously saved product.  After the value in the Net Delivered Price field gets updated, you can still override the value if you choose. This helps you maintain the margin you had on the previously saved product.</p>
		<p> The formula used by this button is:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Current.Net Delivered Price = ((Previous.Value Addition + Current.Ingredient Market + Current.Container)) / (1-Current.Standard Increment) + Current.Freight(In Product) - Current.Volume - Current.Other - Current.Pick-up) * (1 - Current.Terms) + Current.Freight(On Invoice or Outside Delivery + Current.Dealer Margin</p>

		<p>Two new columns – Min Weight % and Rounding Factor % – have been added to the Ingredients grid in following areas:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Products Module:<ul><li>Product Worksheet tab – The columns appear when in Ingredient Detail view.</li></ul></li>
			<li>Diets Module<ul><li>Formulate tab – The columns appear when a product is in change mode.</li><li>View Product window – Appears when you select Products &gt;&#160;View Product while a product is in change mode.</li></ul></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Use the new columns to __________________?.</p>
		<p>The two fields work together to _________________?</p>
		<p>Details about the new columns follow:</p>
		<p><b>Min Weight %</b>
		</p>
		<p>Displays the minimum weight percentage [DESCRIPTION]</p>
		<p>An alert appears when you enter a minimum ingredient inclusion in the formula and when the ingredients you have entered are below the minimum inclusion. The alert prompts you to address the issue before you order the product. Previously, this step occurred at formulation in BILLS and required additional communication time as formulators contacted consultants about changes in the formula before it went to production.</p>
		<p>Min Weight % is calculated for each ingredient as follows:&#160;Minimum Weight / Minimum Batch Weight * 100. If the value in the Minimum Weight field for the plant ingredient is equal to 0 or null, or the value in the Minimum Batch Weight field for the location is equal to 0 or null, no value is displayed in the Min Weight % field.</p>
		<p>For example, if the Minimum Weight was .033 and the Minimum Batch Weight was 2000, the calculated percentage is:   .033/2000 * 100 = .00165%.</p>
		<p> If the Minimum Weight % value is greater than the value in the product result field, the background color of the Minimum Weight % field will turn <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">yellow</span>. The yellow background indicates that the ingredient does not meet the minimum weight quantity required in BILLS – it will potentially be rounded out in BILLS and not included in the final product. You should adjust the product before submitting it to the formulator.   If you do not adjust the product before submitting/ordering it, the formulator will need to adjust the product formula to meet product nutrient requirements.    Turn the results in both columns yellow if this case is true.</p>
		<p><b>Rounding Factor %  </b>
		</p>
		<p>Displays [DESCRIPTION]</p>
		<p>Rounding Weight % is calculated for each ingredient as follows:&#160;Rounding Weight / Minimum Batch Weight * 100. If the value in the Rounding Weight field for the plant ingredient is equal to 0 or null, or the value in the Minimum Batch Weight field for the location is equal to 0 or null, no value is displayed in the Rounding Factor % field.</p>
		<p>  For example, if the Rounding Weight was .005, and the Minimum Batch Weight was 2,000, the calculated percentage is:   .005/2000 * 100 = .00025%.   If the value in the Rounding Weight field for the plant ingredient is equal to zero or null, or the value in the Minimum Batch Weight field for the location is equal to 0 or null, then the value displayed in this field should be null.</p>
		<p> If the value in the ingredient result for the product formula is less than the Minimum Weight %, value and greater than or equal to the Minimum Weight % minus the Rounding Factor %, then the background color of the Rounding Factor % field will turn turned <span style="background-color: #00ffff;">blue</span>. The blue background indicates that the ingredient will be rounded up to the Min Weight Quantity % in BILLS, and the ingredient will still be included in the final product. You can set a minimum on that ingredient at the Minimum Weight % to do this in MAX.  Turn the results in both columns blue if this case is true.  If this case is not true, and the first case is still true, leave the results yellow in both columns.</p>
		<p> The values displayed in the Minimum Weight % or the Rounding Factor % fields should not change by the selection of the imperial / metric setting selected within the view menu on the Product Worksheet screen as the values in these two fields stored on the client have already taken into account the minimum production batch size (the metric or imperial setting) of the plant location.</p>
